### Predicting High-Quality White Wines Using Machine Learning

**Code**:  [**Wine Quality Prediction**](https://github.com/angelahe28/BAPortfolio/blob/main/He_Angela_p1.ipynb)

**Goal**: To build a classification model capable of predicting whether a white wine will be judged as "high quality" based on its chemical properties, helping winemakers assess quality prior to judging events.

**Description**: This project leverages a dataset of white wines and their chemical properties to preduct whether a wine will be classified as "high quality" by professional judges. By analyzing features such as chlorides, sulfur dioxide levels, density, pH, and alchohol content, a decision tree model was used to classify wines into high-quality and non-high-quality categories. This analysis provides actionable insights for the wine industry to refine production processes and focus on quality indicators.

**Skills**: Data Cleaning and Preparation, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Importance Analysis, Visualization and Reporting

**Technology**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

**Results**: Developed a decision tree model with an accuracy of 85% and an F1-score of 0.83 in predicting wine quality. Identified alchohol content and total sulfur dioxide as the most influential predictors of wine quality.
